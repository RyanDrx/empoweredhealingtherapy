[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "virtual:astro-icon" from "/Users/ryandierickx/Documents/GitHub/empoweredhealingtherapy/theme/node_modules/.pnpm/astro-icon@1.1.5/node_modules/astro-icon/components/Icon.astro".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
