  "whatIsSE": "Somatic therapy is a holistic approach that recognizes the connection between mind and body. It is based on the understanding that our physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts are interconnected and that addressing one aspect can have a positive impact on the others. \n\nIn my practice, I use somatic therapy to help clients become more aware of their body sensations and emotions, and how they are related. By bringing attention to the present moment, my clients can learn to understand and release long-held physical and emotional tension. This can result in a greater sense of self-awareness, increased emotional regulation, and improved overall well-being.",
  "whySE": "Somatic experiencing is a powerful therapeutic approach that helps individuals heal from traumatic experiences by accessing the body's natural healing abilities. Through somatic experiencing, patients can learn to regulate their nervous system and release tension, which can lead to reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. \n\nThis technique promotes greater self-awareness and a deeper understanding of the mind-body connection, empowering patients to make positive changes in their lives. In my therapy practice, I specialize in somatic experiencing and offer a safe and supportive environment for patients to explore this transformative approach. Reach out today to learn more about how somatic experiencing can benefit your mental and physical well-being."
