That's why I offer a complimentary 20-minute phone consultation to help you determine if I am the right fit for you. During this consultation, we'll discuss your needs and concerns and answer any questions you may have about our services. ",
  "medicalInsurance": "I'm pleased to inform you that my therapy sessions are accessible to a wide range of individuals, as I accept insurance plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield. This initiative is part of our commitment to making mental health care more reachable for everyone.\n\nFor those whose insurance providers are different, there's a seamless solution. I can provide reimbursement superbills upon request. These superbills allow you to seek partial or full reimbursement from your insurance company, depending on the details of your plan.\n\nIt's advisable to engage with your insurance company prior to starting therapy. Gaining a clear understanding of your coverage, such as eligibility and the extent of reimbursement for services in a private therapy practice, will help prevent any unforeseen expenses or complications.\n\nInvesting in mental health is a vital step towards wellbeing, and I'm here to support you with various insurance options to facilitate your path to recovery.",
