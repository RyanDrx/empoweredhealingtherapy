  "telehealth": "Telehealth has become an increasingly popular option for mental health therapy in recent years, and for good reason. One of the main benefits of telehealth is its convenience—patients can receive therapy from the comfort of their own home, office, or any location with a stable internet connection. \n\nThis flexibility allows for greater scheduling options and eliminates the need for travel time and expenses. Additionally, telehealth removes potential barriers for patients who may have difficulty leaving their home, live in rural areas with limited access to mental health resources, or have physical disabilities. My therapy practice is experienced in providing telehealth services and utilizes secure and reliable technology to ensure confidentiality and privacy. Contact me today to learn more about the benefits of telehealth and how it can support your mental health needs."
